# AIGen-(Automatic INput GEnerator Tool)


This repository contains codes to generate on-the-fly inputs from different programs. As a testing version, I have developed an automatic code generator for DFTB+ 
employing the jinja2 library. The input file can be create by simply calling python code lines (responsible of creating blocks of the input file). The full input is 
assembled and printed to a file that can be executed to launch the calculation using subprocesses library or i-PI protocol.

Under development, any contribution or suggestion is welcome!
